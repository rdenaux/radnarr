# RADical NARRatives Taxonomies

This repository provides a collaboration space for refining the Radical Narratives Taxonomies developed as part of the [TRIVALENT EU project](https://trivalent-project.eu).

It still needs to be decided whether the final taxonomies will be made available to the wider public, or whether they will be available only to TRIVALENT partners.

## Overall design
The basic design of the taxonomies is described in detail in Deliverable 3.2 of TRIVALENT. However, since it is not a public document, we provide a short description here.

The taxonomy has been derived from a couple of lists of ISIS `strategic narratives` (one provided by the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism [1], and the second provided by domain experts from the [Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya](http://www.idc.ac.il/)), from the literature review performed as part of TRIVALENT and described in deliverables 2.1 and 3.1 (both of which are public documents).  In particular, we are using the list of 'master islamic narratives' as defined by Halverson et al., 2011 [2]. Although most of our primary sources are focused on (specific kinds of) Islamic radicalisation, the overall taxonomies aim to provide a generic framework for analysing radicalisation and radicalisation narratives.

As of May 2018, the taxonomy has 89 nodes organized in 3 sub taxonomies:
*	``Radicalisation indicator``: contains 28 subcategories, divided in 2 sublevels, referring to structural causes and trigger events at all 3 (macro, meso and micro) levels or the radicalisa-tion process. All of these subcategories are generic and not specific to a specific type of radicalisation. The taxonomy itself does not define subcategories for structural cause, trigger event, macro-, meso- or micro-level. Since all of the subcategories are linked to the radicali-sation ontology, we can use it to automatically classify the subcategory into one of these ax-es.
*	``Strategic Narrative``: contains 20 subcategories, divided in 3 sublevels. The first 2 sublevels are generic narratives that can be exploited to promote radical ideologies by some group, and the 3rd sublevel is specific to strategic narratives by ISIS. The first sublevel consists of categories:
    *	``(promote) group identity``: any narrative that promotes the radical group spreading this message, e.g. by promoting a winner’s image for the group, promoting the social as-pects of the group, associating the group with a sense of adventure and in general promoting the ideology of the group (or encompassing groups).  
    *	``Discredit other groups``: any narrative that discredits groups other than the group spreading the message. Typically the enemy is attacked, although similar but com-peting groups are often also discredited.  
    *	``Sow discord between groups``: whereby divisions between groups are exploited and reinforced.  
    *	``Moral obligation``: narratives that appeal to social and cultural norms to justify a certain type of action. 
*	``Islamic Master Narrative``: contains 37 subcategories, divided in 3 sublevels. The 11 subcate-gories in the 1st sublevel are those proposed in (Halverson et al., 2011) and further sublevels provide more specific sub-arguments within the narratives.
